after cloned the project
open terminal in the project files
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate      
then install django 4.0.0 by pip install django~=4.0.0

python manage.py makemigrations new_page
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate 

python manage.py createsuperuser

now youre good to go, whenever you want to run the project, activate the venv(most of the time vs code otomaticly does it but it never a bad idea to do it your self)
and then just type py manage.py runserver
